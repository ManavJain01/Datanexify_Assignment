I'm a full stack web developer...

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Application (MCA) from the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Raipur, and I have completed my graduation from Jiwaji University, Gwalior. I have a passion for frontend development and have been working on various full stack projects using the MERN stack.
